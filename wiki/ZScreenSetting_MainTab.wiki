#summary The Main tab of Zscreen

= Introduction =

This page describes the "Main" tab of Zscreen.


= Details =

This tab is designed to provide quick-change settings.

You can change the destination websites (Zscreen lets you define a separate destination site for image, text, file and URL.)

Zscreen is capable of capturing the screenshot after a preset delay (with reference to the "hotkey press" instant). You can set this delay here.

You can also define the URL format.

Zscreen allows you to save each screenshot as a file (with an automatically incremented number suffix). However, you can also let ZScreen prompt you for a file name after each capture (so that you can enter a meaningful name for each captured image).

ZScreen allows you to capture the mouse cursor along with the screenshot. If you do not want this, unselect this check box.
