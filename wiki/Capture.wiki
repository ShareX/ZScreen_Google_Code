#summary Overview of the screen capture modes available in Zscreen.

As described in the overview, ZScreen can capture screenshots in six different modes.

When you select the *Capture* tab, ZScreen shows six sub-tabs.
Each of these sub-tabs contains settings for a particular capture mode.
Typically, you would be using one or two modes.
So, you need to change the default settings for those modes only.

The following sub-pages of wiki explain the settings for each capture mode.
